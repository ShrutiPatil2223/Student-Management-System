# Student Management System

Hello,
This repository contains Student Management System Project using python.

## General
This repository contains basic Student management System where one can Create, Update, Display and Delete the students from the system.
There are three files related to the project : 
- main.py
- mydb.py
- student_gui.py
I have showed the Graphical User Interface in this project. 
[GUI](https://github.com/ShrutiPatil2223/Student-Management-System/blob/main/GUI_Screenshot%20.png) of the project can be found here.
 
  
##1. Git
I have never used git before, so being a novice user I am, while working on this project I got to know a lot about git. 
Things I learned from the git are - Clone, push, pull, commit, seamless integration with other tools like in my project, they are sonarcloud and Gitlab-CI.
