[GUI](https://github.com/ShrutiPatil2223/Student-Management-System/blob/main/GUI_Screenshot%20.png) of the project can be found here.
 
  
## 1. Git
I have never used git before, so being a novice user I am, while working on this project I got to know a lot about git. 
Things I learned from the git are - Clone, push, pull, commit, seamless integration with other tools like in my project, they are sonarcloud and Gitlab-CI.
And most important is how it helps to track the project activities.
